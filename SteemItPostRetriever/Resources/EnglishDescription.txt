This software will fetch your account posts summaries
and send them to the database specified. 

Before using this software, you should have created 
the database and ran the MySQL.SQL file script to 
create the table that will store your posts summaries.

To show the posts summaries on your website, edit the
SteemitPosts.php changing the MySQL Information
to match your MySQL Server address and credentials
and upload it to your web server. You must have PHP
installed on your web server for this script to run.

That's all! 
Enjoy showing your Steemit posts on your website!
