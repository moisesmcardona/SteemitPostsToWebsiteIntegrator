# SteemitPostsToWebsiteIntegrator

This software will fetch your account posts summaries and send them to the database specified. Before using this software, you should have created the database, which can have any name, and ran the MySQL.SQL file script located in the SteemItPostRetriever folder to create the table that will store your posts summaries. 

To show the posts summaries on your website, edit the SteemitPosts.php, located in the SteemItPostRetriever folder, changing the MySQL Information to match your MySQL Server address and credentials and upload it to your web server. You must have PHP installed on your web server for this script to run.

The PHP can be integrated into drupal. You just have to copy and paste the SteemitPosts.php file content into a new basic page in drupal and use the PHP code text format. For a demo on how the page looks on drupal, take a look at http://moisescardona.me. It is possible that the actual font vary depending on the theme you're using.

That's all! 
Enjoy showing your Steemit posts on your website!
